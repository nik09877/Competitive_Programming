Pok&#xE9;mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok&#xE9;mon army to resist.</p><p>First, Andrew counted all the pok&#xE9;mon&#xA0;&#x2014; there were exactly $$$n$$$ pikachu. The strength of the $$$i$$$-th pok&#xE9;mon is equal to $$$a_i$$$, and all these numbers are distinct.</p><p>As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $$$b$$$ from $$$k$$$ indices such that $$$1 \\le b_1 &lt; b_2 &lt; \\dots &lt; b_k \\le n$$$, and his army will consist of pok&#xE9;mons with forces $$$a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \\dots, a_{b_k}$$$.</p><p>The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $$$a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\dots$$$.</p><p>Andrew is experimenting with pok&#xE9;mon order. He performs $$$q$$$ operations. In $$$i$$$-th operation Andrew swaps $$$l_i$$$-th and $$$r_i$$$-th pok&#xE9;mon.</p><p><span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">Note: $$$q=0$$$ in this version of the task.</span></p><p>Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok&#xE9;mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.</p><p>Help Andrew and the pok&#xE9;mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.</p><p>The first line contains one positive integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$) denoting the number of test cases.
