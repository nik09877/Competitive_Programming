The restaurant has $$$n$$$ tables arranged along a straight line. People are already sitting at some tables. The tables are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in the order from left to right. The state of the restaurant is described by a string of length $$$n$$$ which contains characters &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>&quot; (the table is occupied) and &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>&quot; (the table is empty).</p><p>Restaurant rules prohibit people to sit at a distance of $$$k$$$ or less from each other. That is, if a person sits at the table number $$$i$$$, then all tables with numbers from $$$i-k$$$ to $$$i+k$$$ (except for the $$$i$$$-th) should be free. In other words, the absolute difference of the numbers of any two occupied tables must be strictly greater than $$$k$$$.</p><p>For example, if $$$n=8$$$ and $$$k=2$$$, then:</p><p></p><ul> <li> strings &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10010001</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10000010</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">00000000</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">00100000</span>&quot; satisfy the rules of the restaurant; </li><li> strings &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10100100</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">10011001</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">11111111</span>&quot; do not satisfy to the rules of the restaurant, since each of them has a pair of &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>&quot; with a distance less than or equal to $$$k=2$$$. </li></ul><p></p><p>In particular, if the state of the restaurant is described by a string without &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>&quot; or a string with one &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>&quot;, then the requirement of the restaurant is satisfied.</p><p>You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ that describes the current state of the restaurant. It is guaranteed that the rules of the restaurant are satisfied for the string $$$s$$$.</p><p>Find the maximum number of free tables that you can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. Formally, what is the maximum number of &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span>&quot; that can be replaced by &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span>&quot; such that the requirement will still be satisfied?</p><p>For example, if $$$n=6$$$, $$$k=1$$$, $$$s=$$$&#xA0;&quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">100010</span>&quot;, then the answer to the problem will be $$$1$$$, since only the table at position $$$3$$$ can be occupied such that the rules are still satisfied.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)&#xA0;&#x2014; the number of test cases in the test.
